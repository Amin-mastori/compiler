Creating a README file to explain your grammar can be really helpful for anyone who wants to understand or work with it. Here's a template you can use as a starting point:

# Grammar README

## Description
This grammar defines a simple arithmetic expression language with support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, assignment, identifiers, and numerical values.

## Files
- `grammar_main.g4`: Contains the ANTLR grammar specification.
- `example_programs/`: Directory containing sample programs showcasing the grammar.

## Structure

### Productions
- `start`: Represents the main entry point of the grammar, defining an assignment statement consisting of an identifier, an assignment operator, and an expression, terminated by the end of file (EOF).

- `expr`: Defines expressions using arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and base terms.

- `term`: Describes multiplication, division, and base factors.

- `fact`: Defines factors as identifiers, numbers, or expressions enclosed within parentheses.

### Lexical Rules
- `Plus`, `MINUS`, `MUL`, `DIVIDE`, `ASSIGN`: Tokens representing arithmetic and assignment operators.

- `Id`, `Number`: Tokens for identifiers and numerical values, respectively.

### Lexical Structure
- `IDENTIFIER`: A fragment representing an identifier, starting with a letter and followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.

- `NUMBER`: A fragment representing numerical values consisting of one or more digits.

## Usage
1. **ANTLR Tool**: Use the ANTLR tool to generate lexer and parser code from the grammar file.
   ```bash
   antlr4 grammar_main.g4
   ```

2. **Integrate Generated Code**: Incorporate the generated lexer and parser into your application or tool to parse and analyze arithmetic expressions written in this language.

## Example
An example program demonstrating the usage of this grammar:
```text
x = 5 * (3 + 7)
```

You can customize this template based on your specific needs, add sections like "Testing," "Limitations," or "Future Work" if necessary, and provide more details about how to run or test the grammar. Don't forget to replace placeholders like `[License Name]` and add relevant information about your actual license, credits, and usage instructions.
